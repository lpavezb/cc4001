/*
Consider two integer sequences f(n) = n! and g(n) = an, where n is a positive integer. 
For any integer a > 1 the second sequence is greater than the first for a finite number of values. 
But starting from some integer k, f(n) is greater than g(n) for all n >= k. 
You are to find the least positive value of n for which f(n) > g(n), for a given positive integer a > 1.

Input
The first line of the input contains number t â€“ the amount of tests. 
Then t test descriptions follow. Each test consist of a single number a.

Constraints
1 <= t <= 100000
2 <= a <= 1000000

Output
For each test print the least positive value of n for which f(n) > g(n).

Example
Input:
3
2
3
4

Output:
4
7
9
